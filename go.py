This program plays the game go
It has a goSquare class, a goGrid class, and a goFrame class.
The goSquare is an individual square from the goGame which has an attribute
for its position and color. It has methods for drawing a circle and removing one.

The goGrid contains all of the goSquares and also handles making moves and the UI

The goFrame handles all of the logic and end of game stuff.
